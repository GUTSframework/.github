# GUTS - Grand Unified Trajectory Sampling

The GUTS framework brings together the path sampling (PS) community around a common modeling framework.
It aggregates the wealth of algorithmic and software developments produced over the past two decades, and distributed over multiple
packages: [OPS](https://github.com/openpathsampling/openpathsampling), [pyRETIS](https://gitlab.com/pyretis/pyretis), [asyncmd](https://github.com/bio-phys/asyncmd) and [infRETIS](https://github.com/infretis/infretis).
